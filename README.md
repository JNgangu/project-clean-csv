# Project 1: Clean Messy Sales Data

This project shows how I cleaned and prepared messy sales data using Python and Pandas.

---

## Files
- `fresh_messy_sales.csv`: raw data with inconsistent formatting
- `project1_clean_csv.py`: script used to clean the data
- `cleaned_sales_output.csv`: final cleaned version

---

## What I Did
- Cleaned names (removed extra spaces, fixed casing)
- Converted prices and quantities to numeric types
- Handled missing values using NaN
- Fixed date formatting using `pd.to_datetime()`
- Exported the cleaned file for analysis

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas

## What This Shows
This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Real-world data cleaning
- Handling missing or bad data
- Working with dates, numbers, and text
- Saving results for analysis
